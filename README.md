# Python-Challenge-1
For this challenge, I was provided starter code for printing a menu for customers. I was tasked with adapting this menu to allow customers to place an order, maing sure the customer's order is stored and a receipt is printed at the end with the total price of all items they ordered. I was provided assistance by some of my classmates, Kyle Sellers and Jennifer Galvan. Sean Morey, the instructor of the class, was a big help. I lastly received assistance from TA Noor Kurbanali, and Brandon Wong, a BCS tutor. I also could not have been able to finish this code without the help from the BCS Xpert Learning Assistant.

* The finished code initially presents the customer with categories from which they can choose from, like; snacks, meals, drinks, and desserts.
* Based on the customer's first selection, they are provided with the options available under each category and are able to make their choice by an assigned numeric value, or integer, for each option.
* If for whatever reason the customer does not make a selection using a numeric value they are advised to try again and to make a valid choice.
* The customer is given the option to make as many selections as they would like and are then presented with a receipt showing items ordered, how many of each item they selected, and the price for each item(s).
* Lastly the code is able to add everything up and provide the customer with their total cost.
